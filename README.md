# InvisiLang

InvisiLang is a small, scripted programming language in which all executed source code is exclusively made up of 'invisible' UTF-8 characters. 

This project contains both the standard and and implementation written in C, both called InvisiLang. 

The usage of InvisiScript should be limited to invisible-related topics.
